# Field Codes Documentation
This document describes the source of the field codes for each subject area. They are described in the order of their .json files. The subject areas themselves are dileneated by [Scimago journal rankings](http://www.scimagojr.com/)

For now, assume all field codes are CIP codes with the exception of JEL codes for economics. I'm not aware of other subject-specific field code standards. CIP 2000 https://nces.ed.gov/pubs2002/cip2000/

Also, should we include "keywords" as a distinct feature compared to "tags," or are these the same thing? Eg an academic paper will contain keywords.
