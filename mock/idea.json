  "idea-text": "Schools of thought are touted as methodological distinctions, but I hypothesize there are strong ideological connections due to cognitive dissonance theory. Causality could go either way. 3 key examples include Islam, Christianity, and secularism. Islam and authoritatrianism, expected to correlate with keynesian economics and progressive ideology. Christianity mixes authoritarian and laissez faire themes, but original sin is contrary to the Austrian idea that everyone is necessarily rational and objective value of concepts in Chicago Price Theory and fundamental financial analysis. Austrian rational necessity, radical subjectivism, and opposition to central control jive with secularism including atheism and agnosticism.",
